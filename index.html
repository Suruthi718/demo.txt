<h2>About This Project</h2>

<p>
    This project is designed to help users learn about modern agriculture technology and connect with other farmers online.
    It provides features such as plant uploading, real-time chat, and an order system for purchasing and selling trees or plants.
    The goal is to support farmers with an easy-to-use online platform that improves their business and communication.

<p>
    Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project focuses on user-friendly design and accessibility.
    Future improvements include adding a Tamil-language chatbot, mobile app support, and secure payment gateway integration.
